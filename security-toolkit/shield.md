# Shield

DeFiYield's Shield is the best way to ensure that any assets in your wallet(s) are safe. This means we are always systematically scanning the smart contracts you have interacted with, any token contracts you are currently holding and any approvals you have granted to third-party contracts on any of our supported blockchains.

## ERC-20 Token Safety

By analyzing any tokens in your wallet(s), we are able to highlight any high-risk tokens that may potentially lead to exploits, rugpulls or other unexpected outcomes with little to no action necessary on your behalf:

We will clearly define what the issues we have detected are with any given ERC-20 token, as well as display your exposure to any risky contract.

## Approvals Check

Along with our token-specific safety measures, we also are able to advise you on any outstanding approvals you have granted to any smart contract, and how much risk you are undertaking by having a token approved, based on how many of such token you have available in your wallet:

Unlimited approvals are particularly dangerous to maintain, especially when holding a large amount of the approved token in your wallet. This page will allow you to revoke any unnecessary approval with a click of a button, ensuring that your assets cannot be moved by any exploited or intentionally malicious smart contract.

Updating any approval amount is also extremely easy through our Shield page, allowing you to quickly fix an unlimited approval to something more reasonable, or increase the approval amount if require a large transaction to go through:

## NFT Safety

Similarly to our ERC-20 token safety checks, we also provide ERC-721 (NFTs) safety checks to ensure that you have no outstanding approvals given to exchanges, trade contracts, etc.

On this section you will also be able to easily revoke any approval you deem unnecessary, ensuring that your NFTs are safe in your wallet at all times.
